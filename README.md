# Pico_Embedded_Framework
Organize code and documents for a software framework to be used with Raspberry Pi Pico W projects

1/1/25 I am creating instruments for use in plant sciences based on the Pico W. I am also working with ChatGpt on this since it helps me do in an afternoon what would have taken a week before.
I'm not a guru on github, so I am trying to learn to use it while also developing the instrument hardware and software.
Please expect odd usage as I'm learning. I think I'll like understand how this should have been done the day before the project ends AND I won' go back and redo it. Lessens learned: next project.


I will provide below links to living Google Docs documenting this work.
